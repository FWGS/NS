RC: resource cost
BT: build time (unitless, maybe call it something special like Hirshelm)
H: health (how much damage it can take before being destroyed)
DM: damage
ROF: Rate of fire

Buildings don't have armor in the strict sense, so I take it when you say this you mean, "how much damage can it take?".  I know it sound sound weird to talk about building "health" so that sounds good to me.

Regeneration upgrade
- Regens every 2 seconds
- Heals 1 point at level 1, 2 points at level 2 and 3 points at level 3

Redemption upgrade
- Only will fire when alien is at 40% health or less
- Will never redeem you to a hive that's 500 range away or closer
- I can't really give you any numbers here, they are unitless. 

Adrenaline:
- Aliens within range of primal scream get energy back 60% faster.  Screams don't "stack" (umbras don't stack either)
- Aliens recover 8% of their energy per second.  Each level of adrenaline increases this by 33% (so level 3 adrenaline would give adren back double speed, at 16% of the full amount per second)

Celerity:
- Each level increases speed by set amount.
- This set amount varies from alien to alien.
- These amounts are as follows:
l1: 25
l2: 25
l3: 25
l4: 25
l5: 45

So a skulk with 2 levels of celerity moves at his base speed plus 2x25.  The base speeds for the aliens are as follows:
l1: 290
l2: 170
l3: 200
l4: 210
l5: Depends on galloping.  The max is 350. (don't worry about documenting this yet, it's a bit weird and will likely be reworked or removed)

So a skulk with 2 levels of celerity moves at 290 + 2x25 = 340

Silence:
Sounds that are affected by silence are reduced in volume. 
Level/Percent volume

Enhanced sight.  Oops, this isn't "Advanced Hive Sight" but enhanced "regular" sight.  Each level of this ability makes enemy structures and entities glow brighter.
It's currently a bit buggy though, as low levels of enhanced sight can make entities harder to see instead of easier.

Scent of fear - If an enemy player or structure is at 33% of their full health or below, and is within range, they show up as a special type of entity on hive sight.
level 1 - range 700
level 2 - range 1400
level 3 - range 2100
