<p><b><font size="2">Morale and resource model for humans</font></b></p>
<p><font size="2">The resource system is modelled through likelihood of resources 
  getting put to good use. If a player has shown his competence, he continues 
  to receive resources. If a player fails at his role, he is given less resources 
  because he has shown that he is less likely to put them to good use. This system 
  is justified in the backstory but also promotes teamwork and protecting of teammates. 
  The more players under a player's command, the more his resources depend on 
  their livelihood. With this greater responsibility should come a bigger reward: 
  knowledge that a successful mission was in large part to his own efforts and 
  leadership? An extra sub-menu with special commands? Special priviledged upgrades? 
  </font></p>
<p><font size="2">Every x seconds, a resource injection is administered. The maximum 
  size of the injection is determined by a starting number, then increased by 
  number of aliens killed. The resources a player receives at regular intervals 
  is proportional to percentage of those below a player in the chain of command 
  (if any) that are alive. This proportion is multiplied with the current maximum 
  resource injection to determine the actual injection. Whenever a squad leader 
  receives resources, the players under his command who AREN'T squad leaders also 
  receive it. Example: Player A is squad leader for Player B and Player C. Player 
  B and Player C are at the bottom of the totem pole and command no one. Player 
  A receives 100% of the resource injection at regular intervals. When he receives 
  it, B and C also get it so everyone gets one 100% of the maximum resource injection. 
  Player B then dies. Player A now only gets 50% of the resource injection, which 
  also goes to C. Another example: Player 1 is the ultimate commander. He commands 
  Player 2, who in turn commands Player 3 and Player 4. It is time to give a resource 
  injection. Player 2 is alive, so Player 1 gets 100% of his resources. Player 
  2 is below Player 1 but is a squad leader, so gets no runoff. Player 3 and Player 
  4 are alive, so Player 2 then gets 100% of the resources. Player 3 and Player 
  4 aren't leaders, so they also get the resources that Player 2 got. Now Player 
  3 dies and it's time to give resources again. Player 1 gets 100% of his injection 
  because Player 2 is alive. Player 2 only gets 50% of his injection because Player 
  3 died. Player 4 also gets the 50%.</font></p>
<p><font size="2">The morale level of a player is proportional to the percentage 
  of players above you in the chain of command (if any) and below you in the chain 
  of command (if any) that are alive and in a defined range. If there were never 
  any players below a player in the chain of command, the number of players in 
  the same squad count instead (those commanded and not other leaders for squad 
  leaders, and close teammates for lowest-level soldiers). If a relevant player 
  is alive but not in range, only 50% of that player's morale bonus is contributed. 
  The morale level for a player is expressed as a percentage and is displayed 
  at all times. Morale gives a player a defensive bonus and an accuracy bonus.</font></p>
<p><font size="2">This system promotes proximity between squads and makes it in 
  a player's best interest to keep his commander and fellow squad mates alive. 
  It also forces the marines to move forward to and kill aliens. It also keeps 
  the aliens from acting stupid and throwing themselves into the marines' weaponry, 
  lest they feed the fire.</font></p>
<p><font size="2">How to make the commander a leader? When the leader is more 
  skilled than the others, it should be evident. Those below him will want to 
  be led and want to feel like they are under the care and guidance of a true 
  protector. How to make the commander a leader and not just another player? He 
  has to have the ability to make decisions that no one else can make, because 
  they don't have as much information. The commander can be in contact with the 
  mothership which has more information about this engagement than he does. Maybe 
  he receives intel about types and numbers of aliens in the vicinity? Informs 
  him when aliens purchase key upgrades? Let him use his &quot;insight&quot; to 
  get glimpses of aliens through walls (or at least vague shape indicating amount 
  and position)? What can we do to make squad leaders feel more responsible and 
  empowered?</font></p>
<p><font size="2"><b>The alien resource model</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2">The aliens have a constantly increasing maximum resource injection. 
  It also increases when they kill marines. They have no morale model or chain 
  of command. The total resources is divided among the number of players on the 
  team (including dead players). If a player leaves the game, that player's remaining 
  resources are divided to everyone else on the team. After an alien player dies, 
  he is presented with a graphical menu that shows all the different aliens he 
  can respawn back as. One or more of the alien choices may not be available in 
  the beginning of the match. There should be a choice in the beginning of the 
  game, not only one alien to select. Alternatively, the player can wait a bit 
  and receive resources before entering. While this menu is up, they can still 
  receive chat messages but are at a dark screen (or inside the alien hive mind?). 
  They can't see the current game in progress.</font></p>

<P>Feature descriptions</P>
</FONT></B> 
<P><font size="2"><b>Alien movement: -</b> Creeping, scuttling and flying</font></P>
<p><font size="2"><b>Buying menu -</b> Marines can buy new equipment, armor and 
  upgrades during the game. The menu is brought by hitting a key. The menu shows 
  the list of items and upgrades and their prices, also showing the amount of 
  points each costs. Any upgrade that is too expensive is drawn in red, any upgrade 
  that is already purchased is drawn in green. The rest are drawn in white. Any 
  equipment or upgrades that are &quot;purchased&quot; are acquired immediately.</font></p>
<p><font size=2> </font><font size="2"> </font><font size="2"><b>Commander </b> 
  - Marines within a certain range of the (a) commander has their fatigue reduced 
  quickly or is completely immune to effects of fatigue. The commander has more 
  responsibility for all his teammates, so his resource level depends on their 
  livelihood. With this increased responsibility, does he get any extra power? 
  To prevent cheating and make the commander role a social distinction, no extra 
  power would be granted. To compensate for this extra responsibility, the commander 
  should get something...maybe he just has an booming and authoritative voice 
  that is distinct from the others. Likewise, the squad leaders should have a 
  distinct voice, and the grunts their own as well.</font></p>
<p><font size="2"><b>Comm radios -</b> When marines use their communicators (team 
  chat), they make muffled chatting noises that the aliens can hear. Besides team 
  chat, marines also have a handful of common sayings.</font></p>
<p><font size="2"><b>Door welding</b> – Marines with welding torch can spend twenty 
  seconds to weld doors shut. Aliens cannot get through closed doors</font></p>
<p><font size="2"><b>Explosive grenades-</b> This is the marines' main form of 
  indirect fire and is a principal advantage over the aliens. It can be bounced 
  around corners and does damage to marines as well.</font></p>
<p><font size="2"><b>Fatigue (marines only) </b>– When a marine runs <b>or fighting</b>, 
  his fatigue level increases. When he is walking, it stays the same and when 
  he is stationary, it decreases. The higher the fatigue level, the slower his 
  movement rate. He will also take slightly more damage from attacks and will 
  take longer to arm his weapon. When a marine is fully fatigued, he cannot fire 
  and his movement rate drops severely. It is important that firing isn't allowed 
  because the machine gun has unlimited ammo. Alternatively, force reloading. 
  The fatigue rules promote planning and &quot;leap-frogging&quot; with teammates 
  and further discourage the one-man army.</font></p>
<div align="center"></div>
<p><font size="2"><b>Flame thrower-</b> </font></p>
<p><font size="2"><b>Gestures -</b> </font></p>
<p><font size="2"><b>Machine gun-</b> Unlimited ammo. Can be upgraded in ROF and 
  damage. Promotes cover fire.</font></p>
<p><font size="2"><b>Marine movement-</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2"><b>Overwatch</b> - Kicks in automatically when weapon is held 
  stationary for a few seconds. Marines stay in overwatch as long as they don’t 
  move, turn, change weapons or gesture. Overwatch increases the amount of damage 
  inflicted on it’s target and automatically starts firing as soon as an enemy 
  passes in range and area of effect of the weapon. Not all weapons can go into 
  overwatch (only machine guns?). Overwatch is disabled when ammo runs out or 
  the marine runs, turns, gestures or changes weapons. Chatting is still permitted 
  and the weapon will still fire even while typing. This lets the marines strategize 
  without immediate fear of death!</font></p>
<p><FONT SIZE=2><B>Queen’s lair</b></font><FONT SIZE=2>- The big room where the 
  queen lives. Aliens spawn here and is their base of operations. The aliens will 
  try to prevent the marines from finding or entering this room for as long as 
  possible so reinforcements can be gathered.</font></p>
<P><font size="2"><b>Resource injections (both)-</b> Both the marines and aliens 
  get intermittent resource points. The queen player gets all the alien resource 
  points, which he can use to produce drones or purchase upgrades. Every marine 
  gets their own amount of resources, with the commander getting more. The marines 
  then handle individual upgrades themselves and buy their own equipment. The 
  marines can also give resources to other marines if they are both within range 
  of a commander.</font></P>
<P><font size="2"><B>Regeneration </b>– Gives all aliens (including the queen 
  and drones) automatic regeneration. Marines must continue to press attack to 
  prevent reinforcements.</font></P>
<P><font size="2"><b>Scuttle on ceiling/walls </b>– Aliens of level 1 and 2 can 
  freely travel on ceilings and walls with no movement penalty</font></P>
<P><font size="2"><b>Stimpack</b> – Reduces fatigue effects and temporarily increases 
  speed </font></P>
<P><font size="2"><B>Turrets - </b>After turrets are placed, overwatch kicks in 
  after a few seconds and the same sound plays. Turrets also have an audio sensor 
  and will track sounds that are close by. It will spin to aim at the nearest 
  sound, overwatch flipping on after it is still for a few seconds each time. 
  This lets aliens outwit turrets. Do turrets fire at any targets or only aliens?</font></P>
<p><font size="2"><B>Wounding </b>– Both marines and aliens move slower and generally 
  are less effective when wounded. This is largely permanent for marines but can 
  be regenerated by aliens when available.</font></p>
<P><font size="2"><B>Victory conditions </b>– The game is immediately won by the 
  marines if the queen is destroyed. The game is won by the aliens when all the 
  marines have been killed.</font></P>

<div align="left">
  <p><font size=2><b><font size="2">Possession-</font></b>Target another alien 
    not controlled by a player and hit possess key. You are instantly in control 
    of that alien. Any alien not controlled by a player, will attack marines within 
    a reasonable range but won't follow them. An alien player can group other 
    aliens with him by targetting it and holding the possess key. After a few 
    seconds, the alien will travel over to the player and will now follow the 
    player and attack the target the player is targetting. Only aliens of the 
    same type as the player can be grouped. In this way, a player can create and 
    control an army. He can also &quot;place&quot; aliens as sentries and set 
    up ambushes.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2"><b>Infestation -</b> Can inhabit enemy player (host). Subject 
    loses ability to speak, gets fatigued quickly and triggers unified hive mind 
    sight for aliens. Unresolved: Is there a way to cure?</font></p>
  <p><font size=2><b>Sphincters </b>- Aliens can enter the queen via sphincters 
    on her. Once inside, they can choose between multiple exits, each one leading 
    to a different part of the map. These sphincter doors exit through ceilings, 
    walls or floors. They can also be entered to quickly travel back to the queen’s 
    lair. They can be destroyed by marines</font></p>
  <p><font size="2"><b>Unified hive mind (UHM) </b>- When alien sees marine, queen 
    and teammates get notified of general location via sound or display, enabling 
    aliens to stalk the marines. Aliens also always know about each other’s locations. 
    The player or enemy type is not disclosed. When drone is spawned, play sound 
    that can always be heard. When upgrade is purchased, play sound that can always 
    be heard. In each case, play chat message from hive mind to all players. Chat 
    messages to and from hive mind are silent so they can’t be heard by marines.</font></p>
