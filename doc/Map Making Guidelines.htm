                        <p>The marines don't know where the aliens starting location 
                          is, so there needs to be three to five starting locations 
                          that are roughly equidistant from the marine starting 
                          location. This fact, along with the desired intentional, 
                          committal and strategic nature of the game, imply a 
                          circular, web-like connected map structure, with the 
                          marine staring point at the center. The desired optimal 
                          behavior for the marines is advancing in one or many 
                          squads, spreading out to find the alien base. Speed 
                          is not to be stressed, a minimum of losses should be 
                          more valuable to winning. The marines should spread 
                          out and find the source of the aliens with some urgency, 
                          but not at a high expense of resources. In the beginning 
                          of the game, the marines have to commit to one or more 
                          branches of the web. A squad that has chosen one branch 
                          shouldn't be able to quickly fall back and regroup with 
                          members that chose another branch, the aliens should 
                          have the ability to cut squads off from each other. 
                        </p>
                        <p>This basic structure should also have areas where the 
                          aliens can take alternate paths, not accessible to the 
                          marines. Ventilation shafts, electrical tunnels and 
                          power conduits allow aliens to ambush and flank vulnerable 
                          marines. These alien-only paths should connect the alien 
                          hive rooms and with each other and allow the aliens 
                          to travel between adjacent web branches. They shouldn't 
                          be overdone though, as the marines need to be able to 
                          easily understand which openings should be watched or 
                          blocked off if they want to fortify an area. There can 
                          be occasional hidden openings, but most should be obvious 
                          gratings, still fans, holes and access tunnels. The 
                          aliens should be encouraged to use the areas accessible 
                          to the marines about half the time. Making tunnels harder 
                          to get to or a farther distance than the regular hallways 
                          could help encourage this.</p>
                        <p>There should be a good choke point or two between the 
                          marine starting point and each hive room, so the marines 
                          can decide to build a safe area, or choose locations 
                          for deploying siege weaponry or phase gates. Ideally 
                          there would be at least one marine-accessible location 
                          from outside each hive room that the marines could shoot 
                          at the hive from. A desired viable strategy would be 
                          finding the hive, fortifying an attack point by welding 
                          all openings shut and deploying siege and defensive 
                          marines. The aliens should prevent this from happening 
                          or upgrade to anti-siege aliens before this happens 
                          or pay the price. In other words, the marines should 
                          be allowed to stage a good attack on the hive, not only 
                          by running into the final room and engaging the aliens 
                          close up on their turf. Generally there should safer 
                          areas where the marines can cover each other and leapfrog 
                          forward, connected by less safe narrow passageways. 
                          The ultimate goal is organized marine movements by squad, 
                          advancing and covering each other.</p>
                        <p align="left">Strive to make the lighting feel dark, 
                          but never actually be dark. A near-dark corner or two 
                          is fine, but never make areas that are completely dark. 
                          This promotes replay and reduces general frustration.</p>

                        to ten alien spawning points arrayed around or within 
                        the hive structure. These rooms should also be conducive

                        passageways and cover suitable for flanking, turning and

                          at all times and hint at which way to go. One way of 
                          doing this is by having the marine starting location 
                          be the highest altitude of the map, then having the 
                          path the each alien hive room be below that. That way, 
                          a marine knows which direction to go to run towards 
                          or away from an enemy. Most importantly, he knows how 
                          to run away and rejoin his team if he wandered off and 
                          is feeling scared...</p>
                        <p>Additionally, the look and feel should change between 
                          the marine and alien starting points. Choose an artistic 
                          style for each side, then carry it through fully. Make 
                          it as though the jungle-like aliens have somehow transformed 
                          their areas of the ship into their natural habitats 
                          from their homeworld. A flooded boiler room could be 
                          decorated with with draped cables and floating debris 
                          to simulate a &quot;bog&quot;. A hive room could could 
                          have treelike structures with connecting &quot;branches&quot;, 
                          formed by fallen transmitters and posts. Make the marine 
                          base camp completely dry, then have some dripping water 
                          nearby, changing to puddles of standing water close 
                          to the hive rooms, then having the hive rooms be waste 
                          deep water. Make the marine side &quot;dead&quot; and 
                          the alien parts &quot;living&quot;. Consider choosing 
                          two drastically different color or lighting schemes 
                          and slowly morphing between them as the players travel 
                          from one area to the other. Try making the marine side 
                          technological and controlled, the alien side organic 
                          and primal, then see how slowly you can transition between 
                          the two. Or make the marine side quiet (good for marines 
                          to hear the alien growls and squeals) then create a 
                          massive fan room and generators that drone out voice 
                          communication and scare the marines as they get farther 
                          away. Or use only ambient and lights coming from fixtures 
                          on the marine side, then only ominous texture lights 
                          towards the aliens. Have little &quot;ambient movement&quot; 
                          on the marine side, then have moving fans, malfunctioning 
                          elevators and unexpected gusts of steam erupting from 
                          pipes as the marines get closer. </p>
                        <p>This continuum will really help players know where 
                          they are, and get them to feel the tension they should 
                          as they leave their territory. Most importantly, get 
                          creative and work whatever continuums you've chosen 
                          into your level as deeply as you can. </p>

                    <tr> 
                      <td> One of the sub-goals that the game tries to accomplish 
                        is to have memorable and cinematic games and to strengthen 
                        to bonds between players. Games where you say &quot;remember 
                        when you punched the elevator button and backed away and 
                        as it slowly opened we say the elevator was FULL already 
                        and turned to run....&quot;. One way to accomplish this 
                        is to have sections of the map which cause a group of 
                        players to pause and look in the same direction, or to 
                        wait for another player to do something. An event that 
                        causes players to realize for a moment, that they're all 
                        doing the same thing. The marines especially should be 
                        watching each other often, so their actions should be 
                        relevant. Creating landmarks like this also makes it easy 
                        to describe parts of the map during or after the game, 
                        allows impromptu battle plans and allows for more reacting 
                        by both sides. If the marines hear a a bay door opening 
                        and they're all in sight, they know the aliens have breached 
                        an area and can react. If the aliens listen for a tram 
                        to start up, they can visualize where the marines are 
                        and try to track them (or the marines can outwit them 
                        by hitting the button and then not using it). So these 
                        landmarks and shared experiences promote interaction between 
                        teams and teammates, and makes the games more enjoyable 
                        and memorable. Try to add at least a few of these elements 
                        per map, especially around chokepoints. Make certain areas 
                        wide enough for multiple players to walk, fly or scuttle 
                        through at once or a quadruple-wide ladder that multiple 
                        players could use. Create somewhat noisy freight elevators, 
                        loading bays, a door that can only be opened by having 
                        two buttons being pressed by two players at once, bridges, 
                        clocks that show you when an event is going to happen, 
                        anything that gets players to recognize each others actions 
                        or makes one player dependent on another. These landmarks 
                        are much more important for the marines, as the aliens 
                        generally will lead coordinated but separate attacks.</td>

                        Maps can create many powerful custom effects. One great 
                        way to do this is to create detailed little sub-areas 
                        of the map that can only be viewed, not entered. Create 
                        a little side-passage with a half of a broken electrical 
                        door showing exposed wires, puddles and blinking lights 
                        behind it. Create wire gratings that only partly conceal 
                        a hopelessly detailed mess of pipes and and wheels. A 
                        hole in an elevator shaft that reveals a cafeteria that's 
                        now a grotto. A crack in the wall that shows a hollowed 
                        out area filled with cables. <a href="http://www.planethalflife.com/crinity">Crinity</a> 
                        is the true master of this and it makes a huge difference

                <p>Another sub-goal of this game is to reduce the amount of time 
                  players spend in a non-immersive environment. So instead of 
                  the text menus to choose your team as in other games, this game 
                  has a the concept of the &quot;ready room&quot;. The theme and 
                  layout of the ready room can fit into the theme of the map but 
                  keep it easy to use. At minimum, there should be a door with 
                  a sign that says &quot;Join marine team&quot;, another door 
                  that says &quot;Join alien team&quot;, one that says &quot;Join 
                  a auto-assigned team&quot; and the last that says &quot;Watch 
                  game&quot;. When you join a server, you spawn in immediately 
                  into the ready room. You choose what you want to do by interacting 
                  with the map, i.e., by walking through one of the doors, or 
                  just hanging out in this area and talking with other players 
                  in the ready room, waiting for the match in progress to end 
                  or the map to change. There is also one more door that should 
                  say or indicate &quot;disconnect from server&quot;.</p>
                <p>The ready room should be an unconnected area of the main map, 
                  but make it far enough away from the main game area so ambient 
                  sounds from one area aren't heard in the other. There should 
                  be at least ten info_player_start entities, as all the players 
                  on the server could spawn in here at once. Make the room dramatic 
                  and make the routes to each door an inviting choice. Maybe an 
                  animated hologram of a marine or an alien inviting players to 
                  their doors will get people into the mood of your map. Use animated 
                  lights on runways leading to the doors, spawn point facing and 
                  other factors and railings to lead players out of the ready 
                  room into the game. Try making the spectator door up a small 
                  stairway to a balcony that implies the height needed to adequately 
                  watch the game in progress. Have klaxons going off at the beginning 
                  of the round for dramatic tension. When a game that can't be 
                  late-joined has started, use the entities below to close the 
                  appropriate doors dramatically and display other instructions. 
                </p>
                <p>When a player wants to leave a game in progress, he can exit 
                  through a door at their starting point labeled &quot;leave game&quot; 
                  or whatever is appropriate and clear for your map theme. </p>
                <p>The ready room is a dramatic way to wrap the game and serves 
                  as a mini meta-game in itself. Unfortunately, it's also more 
                  work for the level designers. If this idea doesn't work out 
                  so well, I'll be adding traditional text menus in..</p>

                columns in the ceiling that house lights and are accessible from

                          depend too much on the gamma being exactly what you

                                                &lt;1,1&gt; (starting at bottom 
                                                left, going clockwise). Quads 
                                                use texture coordinates of &lt;0,1&gt;, 
                                                &lt;0,0&gt;, &lt;1,0&gt;, &lt;1,1&gt;. 
                                                This will roughly halve the performance

                      <td> 
                        <p>There are so many parameters, how do you make your 
                          particle system look good? You can tweak your particles 
                          in real-time, inside the game! Here's how. </p>
                        <p>1. Create your custom particle system in Worldcraft. 
                          You may need to set up temporary entities to make it 
                          easy to repeatedly trigger your particle system. Compile 
                          the map, then test out your map inside Natural Selection.</p>
                        <p>2. Walk over to the particle system you want to tweak 
                          so you can see it.</p>
                        <p>3. Bring up the console (hit the ~ key), type &quot;<b>listps</b>&quot;, 
                          then hit enter. It will show you a list of all the particle 
                          systems that the game knows about right now. Most of 
                          these are used by the game itself, but the custom ones 
                          that your map created should be listed at the bottom. 
                          Each particle system should have the name you assigned 
                          in Worldcraft. Find the name of the particle system 
                          you want to tweak.</p>
                        <p>4. While still in the console, type &quot;<b>editps 
                          &lt;particle system name&gt;</b>&quot; where the second 
                          parameter is the name of the particle system to tweak 
                          (without the &lt;&gt; or &quot;'s). Close the console 
                          by hitting ~ again, then you should see a message that 
                          says something like &quot;found particle system, hit 
                          F4 to edit&quot;. If you don't see this, or you see 
                          an error message, try again, but make sure you type 
                          it exactly as shown by the <b>listps</b> command.</p>
                        <p>5. Now hit F4. You now have access to most of the parameters 
                          specified in your <b>env_custom_particles </b>entity, 
                          but you can change them in real-time! The label next 
                          to each slider always shows you the current value of 
                          that slider. Go crazy and tweak your system while it's 
                          playing, occasionally hitting F4 to temporarily hide 
                          the editing controls so you can walk around and see 
                          everything from other angles. When you're happy with 
                          your parameters, write down the values you changed, 
                          or take a screenshot. Now go back to Worldcraft and 
                          enter these values back into your <b>env_custom_particles</b> 
                          entity and you're done!</p>
                        <p>Note. Whenever you change the &quot;max particles&quot; 
                          parameter, all the active particles are immediately 
                          deleted. This is a technical limitation, not a bug. 
                          Typically you'll just have to wait a couple seconds 
                          after changing this before the particle system is back 
                          to normal.</p>

                                that can be welded shut or cut through, by the 
                                marine's use of the welder. Create the geometry 
                                as it is completely opened, then create a brush 
                                that represents the part to be welded. For a grating 
                                to cut through, this might be a square piece of 
                                grating. For a ventilation shaft that could be 
                                closed off, this might be a metal plate or something 
                                that could've been created out of nearby materials. 
                                Place the brush in place so the area is &quot;closed&quot;, 
                                then create an <b>func_weldable</b> out of it. 
                                Note that <b>func_weldables</b> must be enabled 
                                before they can be welded on. This means a weldable 
                                could be triggered to a door state, so the door 
                                must be closed before welding could commence. 
                                Many weldable entities will use the &quot;start 
                                enabled&quot; flag. If you can't weld your entity, 
                                make sure this is set first.</p>

                                    .mp3 playback in your maps. This can be used 
                                    for subtle background creaking and groaning, 
                                    the hum of space, a dash of music, simulated 
                                    gunfire in the next room, etc. This entity 
                                    is useful because it allows very high-quality 
                                    sound in maps, for smooth clean (almost inaudible!) 
                                    bass, and static-free sound playback. The 
                                    compression of .mp3 files also means you can 
                                    include more and longer sound samples, with 
                                    shorter downloads than .wav files. This entity 
                                    is fully triggerable, so maps can turn sounds 
                                    on and off and work with all sorts of triggers.

                                        entity plays. By convention, .mp3s should 
                                        be placed in the sound directory and should 
                                        be named &quot;mapname-sound.mp3&quot;. 
                                        This will help prevent file name collisions 
                                        and files from being overwritten. For 
                                        example, if your map is called ns_derelict, 
                                        this might be: &quot;sound/ns_derelict-gunfire.mp3&quot;,

                                        this convention. MP3s can be any format, 
                                        any size and can be stereo. MP3s are streamed, 
                                        so it doesn't really matter how big it 
                                        is, less than 200k will be loaded at any
