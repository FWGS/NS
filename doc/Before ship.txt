Stuff to do before ship
- Publically thank Groove Radio and Tag's Trance Trip
- Make sure it works with the retail version of Counter-strike, and mention this publically
- Get server ops to run the forums, they will be swamped (the Opera forums went totally nuts)
- Put link on page that shows how many servers are up and how people are playing
- Contact United Devices about integrating tech into server code
